          I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer with over three years of experience building fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. My core expertise lies in the MERN stack, along with frameworks like Next.js, NestJS, Node.js, and Express for building robust full-stack solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;m equally comfortable on the frontend and backend â€” from crafting responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and MUI, to building secure APIs, managing databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and integrating services like Firebase and Cloudinary.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the code, I enjoy mentoring, exploring new tools in the JS ecosystem, and building projects that solve real problems. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and learning something new with every project.
